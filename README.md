# BOCPDMS: Bayesian On-line Changepoint Detection with Model Selection

This repository contains code from the _Bayesian On-line Changepoint Detection with Model Selection_ project.

## Reproducible Research Champions

In May 2018, Theo Damoulas was selected as one of the Alan Turing Institute's Reproducible Research Champions - academics who encourage and promote reproducible research through their own work, and who want to take their latest project to the "next level" of reproducibility.

The Reproducible Research programme at the Turing is led by Kirstie Whitaker and Martin O'Reilly, with the Champions project also involving members of the Research Engineering Group.

Each of the Champions' projects will receive several weeks of support from the Research Engineering Group throughout Summer 2018; during this time, you will be able to see our progress on the project in this repository. Given our focus on reproducibility, we obviously won't be changing any of the code's functionality - but we will make it easier for you to install, use and test out your own ideas with the BOCPDMS methodology.

You can keep track of our progress through the Issues tab, and find out more about the Turing's Reproducible Research Champions project [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ReproducibleResearchResources).
